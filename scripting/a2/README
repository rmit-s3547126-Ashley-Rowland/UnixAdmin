Running of program
	The program can be run using the A2-s3547126.sh command. This will run the initial function led_menu (the main menu function)

Known issues:
	- While attempting part 6, the process of splitting the processes found using pgrep is for some reason being called within the script itself (whereas I've 
	attempted to store them as an array). Thus the association cannot be built (bash reports an error). I have attempted to use IFS, awk and cut, however each comes up with 
	the same response.
	- since part 6 wasn't completed fully, I haven't implemented the kill command (part 7). I believe it's meant to be completed by passing back a reference to the 
	background process in line 142 (when returning to the led_control_menu) or later (assuming only a single process by that name was found)
